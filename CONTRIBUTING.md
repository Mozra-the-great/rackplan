# Contributing

This is primarily a personal/solo-maintained project. If you're proposing a
change:

## Workflow

1. Never commit directly to `main` — create a feature branch.
2. Branch names: English, kebab-case, prefixed by type — `feat/...`,
   `fix/...`, `chore/...`, `docs/...`, `refactor/...`, `test/...`.
3. Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
4. Open a pull request against `main`. CI (and, where configured, Claude Code
   review) must pass before merge.
5. No `git push --force` on `main`.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features
